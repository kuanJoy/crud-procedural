### CRUD Quotebook
This is a simple CRUD application created using a procedural approach. It was developed before I learned about PDO, OOP, PSR, and MVC. Therefore, please note that this project may NOT meet good practices or standards for appropriate development, as it was made for educational purposes at the start of my learning journey.

### Features
* Form validations
* Simple sign-up / log-in (password hash)

* Sorting & filtering (in admin panel and home page)

### Notes
* The "sql" folder contains global queries to create the database, tables and test rows. 
(NOTE: groups.id_group = 0 and users.id_user = 1 and 2 shouldn't be deleted for correct data displaying)
